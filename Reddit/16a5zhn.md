## Great another crop failure: olive oil

Original post: [https://grist.org/agriculture/climate-change-olive-oil-drought-extreme-heat-europe/](https://grist.org/agriculture/climate-change-olive-oil-drought-extreme-heat-europe/)

> scorching temperatures harm crops and push food prices up. A yearlong drought and a spring of extreme heat in Spain, the world’s largest olive oil producer, devastated the country’s olive groves. Spanish olive oil production fell by a half — from an estimated 1.3 million to 610,000 metric tons — over the past year. Now fears are mounting over the very real possibility that the country’s inventory will run out before the next harvest begins, in October.

							Glad you mentioned this as this how I see the stock market growing. Basically scarcity drives profits, and as foods have very volatile costs don't expect the US to starve aside from the poors, but expect shri lanka and small island nations depopulate as they literally can't afford the population they have.

								People in poor countries will starve first because people in wealthier countries can pay more or have a lot more to offer like alliances.  That said it would only take a few bad years for even the wealthiest nation’s to struggle and fail to feed their people.  When I’m at the grocery store these days things that used to cost a dollar now cost two dollars, when things go on sale there’s still more expensive than they were pre-pandemic, even adjusting for inflation.  So when that $1 box of pasta or $1 pound of chicken thighs is now $5-10 the average American can’t afford to feed themselves.

									We will probably have a year or two of somewhat stability in wealthier nations that start stockpiling what food is left.  After a few more years of bas harvests the wars will start.  Both external and internal as people start seriously freaking out because of a lack of food.

				Russian and Ukraine wheat shortages, as well as Ukraine formerly being the world’s top sunflower oil and seed exporter, led to poorer consumers countries seeking alternatives.
				
				We’re talking war interruptions and sanctions causing shortages and higher costs in natural gas and fertilizers, so less is planted, less is used - for all sorts of food production.
				
				Climate has devastated wheat fields around the world - India, Brazil, France, Italy, etc. Hungary restricted exports of wheat to keep their grain affordable locally. Flooding or heat waves have affected rice production - India has restricted exports of rice except for the most expensive (basmati).
				
				Don’t forget: last year, England estimated half of potatoes lost. This spring, an unseasonably warm winter meant 90% of the state of Georgia’s peaches were lost (peaches didn’t go through enough of s cold spell).
				
				Scarcity and prices go hand in hand, so expect more and more as our climate becomes more and more disrupted.
				
				Climate change will also mean millions more refugees, both internal and external. They will surge into labor markets, and surge into housing markets - just like how our population growth from reproduction, migration from another region, immigration from another country, and urbanization, has contributed to decades of declining wages, a dearth of decent jobs, and skyrocketing housing costs.
				
				People who don’t understand climate change will blame it on corporations, of course. And yes, there will be an element of that - including speculators buying up contracts to resell later, employers further low-balling wages, and landlords raising rents ever higher. But just like reduced housing demand would reduce rents (see how just a few hundred thousand people moving out of NYC (population 8.8 million) caused some rentals to drop as much as 20% in price, the underlying causes will include climate change and deliberate political decisions to greatly increase the population.

								That’s a really good point and by far my biggest problem.

The goal is to properly get to know the neighbors this time and hopefully they’ll be better than the ones I have now.

									You gotta think about it like this. Security. When 911 doesn't work, or even worse the cops are coming for your food for themselves......
									
									You need a watch. 24 hours in a day. Three 8 hour watches. But standing watch for 8 hours isn't sustainable. People get bored. People fall asleep. 6 hour watch would be my max. But even a six hour watch can't be maintained forever. 4 hour is ideal. But you can't have someone pulling even a 6 hour watch 7 days a week forever. You gotta rotate. So, minimum six people pulling six hour watches with minimum rotation. Ideally you want 8 people. That's 8 people you trust with your life that also are proficient in whatever weapons you got. 
									
									And that's all assuming you only need one person on watch at a time. If you've got a decent amount of land (more than an acre or two) you will want at least two people on watch. 
									
									And all of these people will have their dependents who can't be expected to pull watch or you wouldn't want to trust to pull watch. 
									
									You see how having a mutual aid network is fucking essential. Honestly I wouldn't expect to maintain survival with less than 10-15 total people. That's including very small families. 
									
									This is why I have an extremely negative outlook on collapse.  There just aren't that many of us, even those of us who see what's coming, that will be able to pull this kind of group off along with having a piece of land that is suitable to farm and protect. 
									
									This isn't even getting into the medical, communication, contamination, entertainment and leisure aspect of any long term survival. 
									
									But anyone thing they are going to survive by themselves is smoking that good shit hopium.

						Biden released oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve for political pandering. A lot of it was sold on the global market, including **millions of barrels directly to China**. Oddly enough, Biden family members have received millions from China in the past, and no one is allowed to know who has purchased $250,000 and $500,000 paintings from Hunter Biden, who was never known for his art (just like he was never known for having any expertise in Ukraine or natural gas or finances).
						
						It would have made more sense to restrict U.S. oil exports to keep our economy going and gas affordable, and allow modest profit sales to our allies Europe and in Asia to bolster our strategic relationships.

			Olive oil is a good source of unsaturated fat, whereas many other common sources of fat, such as butter and lard, are saturated fat. Neither type of fat is completely horrible for you but many diets often recommend consuming more unsaturated fat than saturated fat.

			> a healthy source of dietary fat. 
			
			No, not particularly.  I mean olives are okay, but is just better than saturated fat.  But because all plants have some fat, “fat sources”don’t need to be chased with processed concentrated oils.  People just like to because dopamine hit of a 4,000 calorie per pound food.  But populations like Okinawa lived on single digit % (calorie-wise) of fat and had the most centenarians and lowest chronic disease including dementia.
			
			It’s always westerners that already live on unusually high fat (about 3x what they can get from natural spectrum foods) that make a huge deal about “healthy fats” while average consumptions runs about 40% of calories.
			
			But no, olive consumption is not going to save anyone from the bad health of excess calories (promotes it), atheroscerosis (promotes it, just less than other fats), or things of that nature.

Not because it wasn't well understood as a systemic problem, but rather that the prime motivation was "keep the oil flowing and profits cranking".

		Also Italian a greek olive orchards are old trees on mountains mostly, they hardly can be mechanized, not enough people to pick the olives, it was really bound to happen, i mean the soaring of the prices ... Do you know any person bellow 40 years old that wants to walk over mud all the winter for a living? 
		
		Despite meteo condition that halted production this year, there isnt workforce for this jobs, i live on a olive region in Portugal and my family has old olive orchards and most of the years it's not worth picking them since not worth monetary wise, this year it's probably worth it, the oil will reach 10euros/liter, so it's sorta worth it, if you need the money. But if you pay a workers to pick olives i dont see how came you will ever see some profit ... also picking olives manually isnt for anyone, it's a labourous a nd somehow skilled work, the migrants will not acomplish it, they dont know how to work...

	Olive oil in Canada (we don't grow any as far as I know) has basically doubled in price in the past few years.  That's a shame, I do love olive oil.

		That's the hyperbole of this particular article:  Yes, *Mediterranean grown olive oil* will become more expensive ... but (( YaY Climate Change )) climates further north will be able to grow olive oil.
		
		Same story for every other human crop.

			>start planting now!  You'll be rich in ten years.
			
			I found a group of volunteers near my family's home (Australia) that have been going around the nearby suburbs and cataloguing all the olive trees that were planted a few decades ago in public parks. They keep an eye on all the trees through the year, then harvest them all over a couple of weekends towards the middle of autumn.
			
			The crazy thing is that while anyone is allowed to pick the olives, the group needed to get all sorts of permits and insurance to do the actual harvest. This, coupled with the price to hire the pressing machinery, means that their oil is usually much more expensive than the stuff imported from Europe.
			
			Oh well, as the prices go up, I guess its now just a matter of time until someone else realises that there is a great resource sitting there in the park, and harvests them all for themselves without any permits or whatever.

	For now, crop failures seem to be happening in a spaced-out manner and across different crop types and growing regions around the globe. But what happens when we start having multiple crop failures in a single year? Multi-year crop failures of many types of crops?

	I think once crop failures start accelerating in the future we'll really be clenching our butts. It's a worrying trend.  

	EDIT: My questions were hyperbole btw. I know what happens sadly...

			Preppers are doing it in the wrong way. Setting up by yourself a few miles outside town means the hungry gangs will go after them first. If you're going to prep for a long collapse get your neighbors involved. Everybody should have their own personal stash and there needs to be a community statsh.

		That’s when people start dying.  Say several crops are wiped out by blight and you can’t quickly replace them like fruit and nut trees or berry bushes.  The climate may be wrong for other staple crops or the land might be wrong.  The real concern is losing multiple staple crops around the world due to unpredictable and shitty weather.  It’s already happening, but most countries are able to take the hit currently.  That said, the days of plowing under crops because of surpluses are basically dead.  When you’re only able to produce enough to meet demand without a surplus that leaves the world extremely vulnerable if you continue to lose crops.

	My family owns about 30 olive trees (we are from Italy), every year we harvest the olives to make our own olive oil. the quantity of oil that we get varies from year to year but we always get the necessary amount for it to last about one year of consumption. 

	This year we have nothing, we won't even try to harvest the olives, It's not worth the effort. I think this has never happened in my 23 years of life.

	Fellow spanish here, yes: the temperatures have been scorching hot for quite some time now, and droughts are damaging not only olive oil production, but almost all of the crops grown in the Peninsula. 

	Plus, olive oil (good olive oil, at least) used to be two or three euros a liter from what I can remember. Now it's almost ten euros per litre.
