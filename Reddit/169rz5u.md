## The reality of Not Invented Here

Original post: [https://billabear.com/posts/reality-of-not-invented-here/](https://billabear.com/posts/reality-of-not-invented-here/)

Original post abstract: Not Invented Here (NIH) syndrome occurs when development teams build solutions internally rather than using existing external options, often with the goal of saving costs. However, the time spent developing these solutions typically ends up costing companies more than the available third-party products. While the motivation starts out positive, internal solutions tend to result in bare-bones functionality that requires ongoing maintenance and has performance issues. The article provides an example of teams improperly building their own feature flag system instead of using a dedicated service like LaunchDarkly. In the end, NIH syndrome proves to be a false economy that leaves companies with inferior solutions that cost more to develop and maintain.

	The authors calculations assume there‚Äôs 0 human effort involved in using something like LaunchDarkly, only license costs.

	You have to evaluate it, get a legal review of the contract, configure outage communications, teach your team how to use the SDK and document your usage best practices, etc. You don‚Äôt just click a button.

	It sounds pedantic/trivial, but ‚Äútool bloat‚Äù is a very real pain in the ass.

		To be fair, having adopted launchdarkly at my own company, it did have zero adoption cost. Shockingly low tbh, we decided we wanted it and had our production app using feature flags a couple of hours later. 
		
		This is a small company with minimal red tape but figured it was worth clarifying just how easy this was. 
		
		I think LD is probably on the very low end of the adoption curve though, with workflow tools being on the higher end (people processes always take longer than tech).

		Sure Mr. poofartpee. There is always cost, but the author picked the example to fit his argument well. Feature toggling systems are really low in adoption costs. SDK's and API's are about the simplest you can find and best practices are basically enforced by that simplicity.
		
		I agree that tool bloat is very real and a pain. But if we're thinking comparatively how is that bloat smaller with building ones own system?

	This article feels like a half hearted attempt, but misses the other half of the argument;  Regulatory compliance, unreliable vendors, abusive pricing mechanics and misaligned value/pricing mechanics.

	NIH can be a real problem, but very often the reason it exists isn't about saving the company a few hundred dollars - most competent developers know how to value their _own_ time pretty well - it's that there's a thousand startups trying to figure out how to get 10$/head out of companies while not providing 10$/head in value - so companies are often forced to roll their own rather than face 50k/year in expenses to have, say, a ticketing system or a wiki or a feature flag for their engineering team.  At that point, spending an engineering week is an obvious tradeoff, and then de-risks my SOC2/GDPR compliance by one more third party.

		Yeah, I'm in medical devices, and including COTS/SOUP is often not worth the effort in an embedded system. You still have to go through the entire V&amp;V process (gather requirements, validate them, verify them, perform integration testing, and then monitor open issues/bugfixes/improvements and include all of that in your development and maintenance plans).
		
		We do it for knowledge we don't have in-house, like crypto libraries, but in general at that point it isn't much more work to just build the damn thing and maintain a proper audit trail (and it follows your coding standards, which is a risk mitigation in and of itself).

		At least in the automotive embedded software world I've seen a lot of vendor solutions that seem to exist primarily as a way for the vendor to sell you consulting services. You buy the product, then need to buy a week long training class to learn how to use it. The training class only covered really high level examples, so now you need a support contract to actually learn how to tailor it to your use case. But the support rep has never dealt with your use case before, so weeks of back and forth with the developers ensue while you twiddle your thumbs waiting be able to use the product for the thing you bought it to do.

			>You buy the product, then need to buy a week long training class to learn how to use it.
			
			My company used a service like this, and it was a massive pain. Every dev needed to take the training class to get permission to access the tool, so if you wanted to change one tiny setting in the config, you either had to spend 20 hours in a training course or create a ticket for a certified developer to do it for you. All the certified developers hated using the tool and their department had high turnover rate, making everything worse.

								Unions are about much more than wage protection. It can also protect in the case that management changes and tries to push for significant new changes. This could be things like trying to cut remote work, cut medical benefits (or restructure them to something less popular), etc.
								
								Believe it or not, other (industrial) jobs have many workers who are various degrees of productive. Same for teachers, who are another pretty common unionized profession. Despite this, these professions were commonly unionized, as there is an understanding that uniting with your coworkers is the most effective way to get higher wages.
								
								For an explicit example, apple currently earns 400k in *profits* per *employee* (not even per SWE, or 10x engineer, or whatever). One way of interpreting this is that apple could currently pay their *average employee* up to 400k more/year while maintaining profitability. Note that this is on top of the employees' current compensation.
								
								How many employees would be able to argue that 400k raise? (again, on top of whatever your current compensation is) Would you, as a 10x employee, be able to get anything close to that? I doubt essentially anyone would.

										My point is to not have a profit-based paycheck. Just that *all* employees at apple could be paid up to 400k more without impacting profitability, e.g. viewing profits as a concrete *bound* on how much more *every employee* can be paid for *the work they already do* without negatively impacting the company.
										
										If you think you can 10x your way to that wage increase, good luck. It's money that's heading to wallstreet rather than you + your other &lt;10x employees pockets for the work you *currently* do.

								Athletes are in unions, actors are in unions. Even doctors have quasi unions (unless you think a legal body somehow deserves the right to limit the amount of doctors that are trained in the USA).
								
								Do you think LeBron James makes the same amount of money as Austin Reaves? lol fat chance, they're both in a union too (same team as well).
								
								The only argument I need that unions are worthwhile is that companies will do everything in their power to prevent them, even going as far as to kill Americans to do so.
								
								Just a bunch of devs that think they have more power than a board and executive team with literally hundreds of millions of dollars at their disposal.
								
								Also big fat L for thinking that current pay has anything to do with how good you are. The worst programmers I've met throughout my career ended up becoming Directors and VPs where they afflicted the worst ideas about SWE across companies with zero accountability while making 3x to 5x more than the typical dev.
								
								If only pay was actually correlated to productivity, but it seems like something you can either get through a union or luck.

									Unions are worthwhile when there are more applicants than there are positions.  Unions are worthwhile when there is significant subjective measurement of your success.  I was a member of the musicians union when I was active and it is the right organization for that job.  I see why it is the right choice for athletes beyond the elite level.  I see why it is the right choice for qa and project managers too.
									
									There are more programming jobs than there are applicants and the measurement of success can be objective.  I don't understand why giving up the benefits of switching jobs to improve your position is worth stability at your current job.  If I wanted that, I could join a government job any time.

										Unions are worthwhile for every person who makes their living selling labor, full stop. There is no category of employee where the majority of them would be better off without a union.
										
										>I don't understand why giving up the benefits of switching jobs 
										
										Who said anything about giving that up? Although by saying "just switch jobs", you're saying that someone deserves to be stuck there, as not everyone in our industry has the ability to job hop like that.

		It's a complex topic. If you use a third party product, you're often sucked into that product's preferred workflow (or lack thereof), and you either have friction adapting your workflow to the product or adapting the product to your workflow instead. Stuff like JIRA and WordPress are perfect examples of this: with enough time, you can make them do whatever you want, but by the time you've done so, you've installed so many add-ons that it's glacially slow and you've put in so much time that you could have built an ad hoc thing that would be faster and perfectly adapted to how your team(s) function.
		
		But then your in-house solution doesn't scale, or you start needing the rest of the company to be on the same software and they have different needs, and the whole thing turns into a clusterfuck anyway. The punchline is, it's never about software as such, it's about organization and communication, and that imposes inefficiencies no matter how you slice it. There are so many things that computers and software just automatically makes better, we struggle to identify the situations where they cannot.

		I did try to exclude enterprises where that happens for legitimate reasons.
		
		But every time I've seen it and it's not a case of an enterprise company where we can't buy it. And it's literally a decision of buy it or build and the team chooses to build it, it's generally been about saving the company money.
		
		I would say the vast majority of developers don't understand their time costs the company money. I've had many literally say "But we got it for free because we built it" and had many scenarios where it's had to be explained to teams that building it is still a cost to the company.

			I've had drawn out fights with management for years about trying to purchase tooling for less than my monthly cost to the company (not salary, all in cost), but I can't get the funding.
			
			So they pay me to make a shitty version that almost works, debug and maintain it, and I keep trying to get money while spending more than I'm asking for. Then senior management comes in and asks why we're building everything ourselves, I explain that if they don't want me to build it then they can buy one of these products (I have actual slides from the last time I asked usually), and they go "that seems like a good idea, I'll push for it" before returning with $0 budget for purchasing and the cycle repeats.
			
			At this point, I make the slideshow, email it to management, and get to work on the dollar store version because I don't have time for their bullshit meetings when I know the outcome.

		It also misses the fact that buying in a third party solution still involves a bunch of in-house time to integrate it. And that integration time will be longer than the integration time for an in-house-developed solution because your devs will understand the in-house solution already (having written it) but will need to learn the 3rd party solution, perhaps from scratch.

	This is a classic case of only acknowledging the cases where it doesn't work. Because of course, you'll remember those. You won't acknowledge when it worked.

			That is slightly different because it's a measurable cost and you stand to lose money. Whereas in OPs case, you actually stand to gain a bunch of money and advantage but that advantage is not measurable.
			
			When you build your own stuff if it goes well nobody notices, but you gained a tonne of value. When it goes wrong everyone notices and says you're an idiot for trying. 
			
			With a security hole it's more like... Patching a hole. The cost is pretty obvious, it's just convincing managers it's worth it.
			
			In the former case engineers get fooled not managers, because they have a hard time looking at opportunity cost.

	So we evaluated LaunchDarkly. We had a requirement that all ~15 members of the team should have dashboard access, and the company also required SSO which put us in the enterprise tier. For us the quote was several thousand $ per MONTH. So we ended up building our own flag system (not from scratch, it ended up leveraging our existing in house CMS instead), and at that price point I think it was a good decision.

	Anyway in general, these days there are a lot of B2B SaaS products which are CRAZY expensive at the enterprise level. Enough so that the mindset of "well it's cheaper than hiring a developer" is not always true anymore. Sometimes it really is cheaper to build. Especially since it's easier than ever to build the thing yourself (with all the fancy cloud platforms) and you probably only need 10% of the full product anyway.

	Just went through an internal security approval system migration. The internal tool worked fine even though no one really paid for it's time. Ie one developer every few months. It's initial inception was two developers for a full year. It had some auditing issues and no upkeep. So the company is paying millions now... for sailpoint. If the time and energy had been devoted that wouldn't be necessary. Best part is, the sailpoint product still uses the core components of the original in house solution because of complexity. LOL.

	This is a very simplistic take on NIH. It is so, so much more complicated than that.

	When building something in house, the risks are (off the top of my head):

	1. CapEx to built it exceeds the appetite of the company and causes delays to product

	2. In-house skill is insufficient to execute and it's only realised half way through the project

	3. It's built so badly that OpEx is through the roof

	When buying something from a third party, the risks are (off the top of my head):

	1. The 3rd party internal operations are so slow that procurement takes months to complete

	2. Challenges from legal due to vendor ToS, SPToS, contracts, kill the whole initiative before completion

	3. Budgetary constraints get in the way of completing the purchase

	4. Vendor squeezes your balls on the pricing

	5. Deceptive or unclear pricing leads you to buy into something that's cheap now but will explode in price a year from now (see Hashicorp, Datadog, Oracle)

	6. Once you're bought in, you find world-stopping bugs

	7. Once you're bought in, you find non-compliance with regulations that you have to abide by (just happened to us the other week actually when we found out, 6 months after purchasing, that our IDaaS vendor does not delete user info after user is deleted, which is not compliant with GDPR)

	8. Once you're bought in you find out your account manager has unlimited holiday allotment and loves the Bahamas

	9. SLAs are shit

	10. Someone forgot to pay the bill and the service stopped

	11. Vendor gets bought out by Salesforce

	12. Account manager took someone above your team leads rank out to a very expensive dinner and now you have to use the vendor not because they're good and you want to but because some random schmo in your company says so

	13. Vendor promises their ISO27001 and SOC2 are on the way and aligned to your launch timelines, so you buy in, but they don't get their certification in time delaying your launch

	14. Enrolling in the product takes forever

	15. Documentation for the product is scarce and it doesn't integrate as well with your tooling (say IAC) as they said it does

	16. The onboarding support engineers are slacking and you have to keep chasing the vendor with ever increasing threats of cancelling the contract if they don't get you onboarded by some date

	17. You have to pull so many people into contract negotiations that you end up bike shedding for a year

	18. You find after buy in that the SDKs are not fit for purpose

	Have a look at these two lists, then consider the though process of a decision maker who understands these risks, when they are asked whether they should "just buy a feature flag system" or "just build a feature flag system".

	I am willing to make the assertion that we are currently in peak vendor bloat. We have a vendor available for every single little software feature you can think of. There's probably a vendor selling left-pad somewhere out there. As CNCF gains more and more steam and reaches the same maturity as the OpenStack foundation, we will see these companies disappear one by one as companies shift from your "LaunchDarklys" to OpenFeature, etc.

	Because reality of many things in software is that actual idea is very small and can be expressed in 100-1000 lines, rest is configuration, documentation, business/people, integration, debugging, testing, compliance, translation, feature flags etc. 

	It's easy to write those 100-1000 lines itself and deal with them in house. Then for each axis mentioned above invest only this much as you need.

	Other thing to highlight is control. You want to control everything about given thing and don't want to depend on others. Because the world we live in is still very segregated and dealing with others sometimes can be difficult for many reasons.

	This article is kind of bad honestly. The overall point is clear, but there's so much nuance to the situation, and the ecosystem is just not that simple.

	Using another company's SaaS puts you in a potentially vulnerable position. If they suddenly decide to jack their prices to unreasonable levels, go under or just discontinue their services, you are now SOL especially if your product's performance depends heavily on it.

	The article also doesn't consider open source self-hosted alternatives. You don't have to reinvent the wheel, but you can still control your infrastructure to the extent you find it viable. It's probably a bad idea to reinvent ElasticSearch, but do you really need to run their cloud offering for your small-to-medium sized project or is a Docker Compose file enough? Are you SURE it's okay to send your customer's data to a third party?

	There are absolutely times where you ought to lean on companies that specialize in what you're trying to accomplish, but please don't ever assume there's no risk involved or that it's always the financially sound option in the long run.

	There are so many things to say about this.

	The calculations don't scale well at a huge company. If it costs $5k for licenses for 10 heads for 2 years, what about 1,000 headcount or 2,000 headcount. You'd think volume pricing would make it worthwhile. But that volume discount is not transparent, is negotiable, and only comes on top of enterprise pricing, the most expensive license they offer for on-prem, since big companies won't use the cloud for many things.

	And custom dev from scratch really is all about ego or resume driven development or pure ignorance. There's build and buy, but most forget about borrow. Just deploying an open source tool and later modifying to suit your needs is often the fastest, best, and cheapest option. But devs start writing code without ever bothering to do 5 minutes of Google "research".

		> And custom dev from scratch really is all about ego or resume driven development or pure ignorance
		
		This isn't always the case, though I can agree it can be sometimes.
		
		For me, custom dev is often about weighing how many painful hours am I going to have to pour into customizing a "turn-key solution" to do what the business is asking for in that moment.... and then again a few weeks later when we've all forgotten the requirements/priorities have changed due to leadership turnover, repeat ad nauseam.
		
		In my eyes, not only will the company have spent a shitload of money on a half-baked solution that requires more money to be set on fire to both get it set up and to figure out connection points and oddities, there's also a good chance I'm going to have to end up franken-fixing and duct-taping together a bunch of bespoke processes/solutions to get it where they need, all the while hoping that I don't pigeon-hole is closer towards a conversation that ends with "unfortunately, that isn't possible with the current solution in the timeframe we need it". Much of that I'm actually okay with, it's the supporting a potentially buggy system 6months - 2 years down the line I really would rather not do because who knows how well a system will behave once it has a few miles on it, unless you have access to the source code.

		Well, the article explicitly talks about small-to-medium sized teams. If you have a company of 2000 developers you can absolutely devote resource to teams who can manage X-as-a-service internally. But the majority of developers don't work in companies of that scale, and for those mid-sized teams products like LaunchDarkly absolutely make sense. Nobody would realistically suggest each company would write their own ticketing system, it's strange to see the reluctance for developers to actually use tooling that is _useful_ to their day-to-day jobs. Why not just pay for a great service and get back to what you're actually being paid to deliver? Your customers don't care how great your in-house feature flagging tool is or whether you bought it off the shelf, they care that you can deliver them a great experience.

			That's fine. I'm suggesting different things that don't all apply to all cases. I think regardless of your size, beyond tiny, some things make sense. The cloud starts to cost too much as you scale to more users. And open-source offers a better return on investment and customizability that vendor software or custom Frankensteins. The ability to get a ton of new features and bug fixes by just changing a version is unbelievable.

	This is a terrible example.  You can use a open source feature flag system and throw it behind a redis cache in 1 day and have all the features you would possible need with feature flags.   There are a ton and I won't list them here.  

	This reeks of incompetent software developers that bloat the expenses of a company.  All these tiny third party use case softwares where your paying per seat per month add up.   

	I might even agree with the premise of NIH but the example given is so terrible that it nullifies any learnings I would take from this article.

	I recently had to sit through an architecture review at work for a "public API service", which essentially turned out to be a hand-rolled API gateway/reverse proxy.  

	CTO 55 minutes into the meeting: "We're an &lt;industry that has minimal compliance requirements> company, not an API gateway company. Why are we rolling our own solution when there's existing software available that does everything we need?"

	Absolutely sublime. Can't wait to get out of this place.

			He's great, but since the company introduced a Chief Engineering Officer (don't even ask) he's stepped back from the engineering side to focus more on the technical ecosystem surrounding our product; fortunately he just so happened to join the review on this occasion.
			
			It's worth mentioning that said CEngO previously worked at Oracle, so it's hardly surprising that he laps this sort of shit up.

	NIH is an issue, but the reverse (not implementing anything in house unless you have to) is just as much of a problem, especially in node/JavaScript and rails. You end up with exabytes of v0.x libraries that get deprecated or hacked just because you can't be bothered to write a three-liner and Sindre Sorhus wrote one.

	Smh.

	Reading the article I wondered, how long does integration of the service take? It's not like you just buy the service and it automagically creates feature flags, and their scope. You also have to subtract that from the estimated time for in house development. And I think, that's not going to be insignificant. Like 80%+ of the time it takes to implement feature flags is actually reacting to them.
